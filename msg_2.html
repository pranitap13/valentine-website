    <p>It's 1 o'clock in the night, yet I can't help but think about you. 
        <br><br>You occupy my thoughts every hour, every day, and every single second. In a remarkably short time, our closeness
         has become something I still find hard to believe.<br><br> The time we've spent together is etched as my fondest memory, and it will remain so forever.
         Time seems to fly when we're together, and during the moments apart, I long for the times we've shared.
       <br><br> My love for you increases with each passing day and I really can't help it and don't even wish 
        to stop.<br><br>I want to love you more and more with each passing day!
        The way you pamper me, the way you care for me, the way you take care of every little thing and your attention to every detail are truly indescribable‚ù§Ô∏è.
       <br><br> All I want to be is just to be yours forever‚ù§Ô∏èüåé!!!!!!!
